Had an issue with Visual Studio 2013/17 on my machine already had typescript and it is causing
the compiler to pick ols version of typescript,to fix it follow below.

If you only need the last version of TypeScript, on both Visual Studios and Visual Studio Code, then you can

delete all previous installations which are located in: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript.
reinstall the latest TypeScript version../app.ts
